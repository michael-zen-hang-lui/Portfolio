My life didn't get interesting until I failed out of University.

After learning the hard way that the academic life isn't for me, I tried my hand at a trade, cuisine.

It didn't take long to decide to attend Le Cordon Bleu, London. I've been living in London for a few years due to being at university, so why not stick around for a while longer?
